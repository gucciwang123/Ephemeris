# Ephemeris 

Uses data from NASA LLR to predict future positioning of the Moon in the night sky.

## Build

This project is currently only being developed for MacOS running Apple Silicon, but I do plan on porting this project to other platforms notable such as Linux, and potentially Windows

This project uses CMake to manage dependencies and build so you must have CMake and GNU Make installed.

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
